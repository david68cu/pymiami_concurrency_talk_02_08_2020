A quick review
==============

| In the the first part of this talk we'll review the origins of async I/O in Python.

| We'll see how Python first achieved multiprocessing capabilities with threads , and then with async I/O

| We'll see how the evolution of iterations concepts  (iterables, iterator and generators functions), created the path
for coroutines .

| All that was missing was an event loop , and all of the sudden Python had asyncio.

| A bloody master strategy, leading by two Titans of Python, that ended with the dismiss of generators,
deterred and renamed from the asynchronous world.

| But make no mistake these two generals, have created for humanity so many things that they for sure are right.

| They have proved time and again in the last decades, by example, effort and sacrifice, that they are usually right.
