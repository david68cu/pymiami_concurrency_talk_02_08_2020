A quick review
==============

| In the the first part of this talk we'll review the origins of async I/O in Python.

| We'll see how Python first achieved multiprocessing capabilities with threads , and then with async I/O

| We'll see how the evolution of iterations concepts  (iterables, iterator and generators functions), created the path for coroutines.

All that was missing was an event loop , and all of the sudden Python had asyncio. A master strategy,
that ended with the dismiss of generators, deterred and renamed from the asynchronous world.
