Important Note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All content in this tutorial has been taken from the references named in the "References" section. What I have done is
researched for the best, most relevant information and organized it in a way that better helps
understand the subject.

I find this to be more efficient than to re-create the same content. In addition, since the creators of these references
are the best of the best, you will be receiving unparalleled information which is prominent to what I could provide.

This course is also a way of recognizing the creators of the content and their life-long  contribution to Python.
Please take a moment to follow their social media, links below,and check out heir companies, courses, trainings and
what they do. You will benefit immensely.

I will start this article by mentioning all the references and documentation used in this Tutorial.
