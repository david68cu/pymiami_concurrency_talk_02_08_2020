Important Note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All content in this tutorial has been taken from the references named below. What I have done is
looked for some of the best, most relevant information and organized it in a way that better helps
understands the subject.

I find this much better than to re-create the same content, and because the creators are
extremely  skilled and experienced professionals and therefore are much more capable and have much more
knowledge than I have.

This course is also a way of recognizing the creators of the content and their life-long  contribution to Python.
Please take a moment to follow their social media, links below,and check their companies, courses, training and
what they do. You will benefit immensely.

I will start this article by mentioning all the references, and documentation used in this Tutorial.
