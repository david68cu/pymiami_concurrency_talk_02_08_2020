# More Careful Threading with Queues
# Interestingly, the rules for threading are just for computing and programming. The physical world is
# full of concurrency as well. Many of these techniques has physical analogs that are useful
# for managing people and projects.

# Read The 5 rules RR1000-RR1005 on the Reference section of th e README.md file
# [Slides and Notes: Key notes on  Concurrency](https://pybay.com/site_media/slides/raymond2017-keynote/threading.html)

# So we will create two Queues,
#
# Queues: counter_queue and print_queue
# Queue Managers methods : def counter_manager(): and def print_manager():

# Read all documentation in the README.md References section
